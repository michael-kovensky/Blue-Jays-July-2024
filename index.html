    <h2>Blue Jays: Month of July 2024</h2>
    <p>The Toronto Blue Jays are 38-45. That is <em>8.5</em> games behind a wild card spot. The trade deadline is only a month away. Will they sell, or hold? Here is the month ahead of them. </p>

  <!-- Highlights of the Month -->
  <div id="hofm" class="hofm">
    <h3 id = "hi">Highlights of the Month</h3>
    <h4>July 1-4</h4>
    <p>The Blue Jays start the month on a four game home stand vs the <strong>Houston Astros</strong>. Highlighting the Astros roster is Jose Altuve and Yordan Alvarez. Houston is a schorching <strong>10-1</strong> in their <strong>last 11 games</strong>, looking to chase a spot in the wild card, or even division. Recent call up of Leo Jimenez will possibly play a part for Toronto. </p>

    <h4>July 5-14</h4>
    <p>A 9 game road trip begins quickly after the Astros homestand. They will face three teams, including the<strong> Seatle Mariners,</strong> the <strong>San Francisco Giants</strong> and the <strong> Arizona Diamondbacks.</strong> These teams are all on the west coast, pairing the Jays for a stretch of late-night games.  </p>
    <p>The <strong> Seattle Mariners </strong> are currently in first in the A.L. West. They have among the best pitching staff in the MLB with a 3.56 ERA and fewest walks allowed at 207. However, their hitting is a different story. They sport the lowest team batting average at .216 and have no real support to their pitching. Because of this, a lot of their games end low scoring. Their pitching is so lockdown that even the best of teams struggle against them. Their situation is comparable to the 2023 Blue Jays, who also had great pitching but poor. Blue Jays will have trouble.</p>
    <p> The <strong> San Francisco Giants</strong> had spent the second most money over the off season. Did they perform? No, not at all. Former Cy Young winner Blake Snell pitched under 30 innings and has been injured twice. Matt Chapman has been an error-maker (unlike his usual self) and Jorge Soler has shown no signs of a comeback. They are among the same boat as the Blue Jays - dissapointing.</p>
    <p> The <strong> Arizona Diamondbacks </strong>made the World Series in 2023. They were clear underdogs. They have not shown much lately. They are however in contention for a wild card spot. By the end of this series, the Toronto Blue Jays should have the clearest view yet for what to do at the deadline. Selling and holding are most likely, while buying is very unlikely. Buying would only occur if the Jays believe they can pull off a Mariners type win streak (come back from 11 games behind in one month).</p>

    <h4>July 20-28</h4>
    <p>The final homestand before the trade deadline. The Blue Jays will face the <strong>Detroit Tigers</strong>, the <strong>Tampa Bay Rays</strong> and the World Series Champions<strong> Texas Rangers.</strong> This homestand is among the easiest for the Jays on the season.</p>
    <p>The <strong>Detroit Tigers</strong> are as typical as they always are: Out of the Miguel Cabrera era and mid-rebuild. They haven't been a strong franchise in years, and the Blue Jays are on roughly the same level as them wins wise.</p>
    <p>The <strong>Tampa Bay Rays</strong> won 99 games last year and were a huge dissapointment from May onwards, completely embarrasing themselves in the wild card. Nothing has changed in 2024. They are still a mediocore team. This does not mean the Blue Jays are better than them, or of the same level.</p>
    <p>The <strong>Texas Rangers</strong> won the World Series in 2023. Their offence-heavy lineup with a disaster pitching rotation and bullpen pushed through in September and October. Their lineup has not shown much this season, and are on the same level as the Toronto Blue Jays.</p>

    <h4>The Trade Deadline</h4>
    <p>July 28-31 will be a choatic few days. The heat of the deadline. It's a four game series, with a doubleheader verses the Baltimore Orioles on the 29th.</p>
    <p>The Blue Jays have reportedly put the following players on the trade block: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Yimi Garcia</li>
      <li>Yusei Kikuchi</li>
      <li>Danny Jansen</li>
      <li>Kevin Kiermaier</li>
      <li>Justin Turner</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The common trend between these players? They are all on expiring contract. This likely means that the Blue Jays would not get much return and would need to trade more to get a greater return.</p>
    <p><em>Bo Bichette</em> and <em>Vladimir Guerrero Jr.</em> could be traded under the right conditions, but will likely not be.</p>
